# [2018 Fashion AI Global Challenge](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/markets/tianchi/FashionAIeng?_lang=en_US)

## Intro:
Upgrades in consumption patterns mean that there is significant room for potential growth in the fashion industry. According to official statistics from different countries, the market value of the global apparel market is worth over USD 3 trillion. Although artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been evolving along with the fashion industry, there are still different challenges in different areas that need to be addressed.

The Vision & Beauty Team, Alibaba Group and Institute of Textile & Clothing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University are pleased to announce that they are co-organizing the FashionAI Global Challenge 2018, which will jointly launch a revolutionary dataset which integrates both professional fashion knowledge and machine learning formulation. The world's first FashionAI Global Challenge offers RMB 1.34 million prize pool, inviting you to solve the imminent issues on the application of AI in fashion.

## Description
#### Key Points Detection of Apparel
The analysis of apparel with computers could be easily affected by the dimension and shape of the apparel, distance and angle of shooting, or even how the apparel is displayed or the model is posing. Contestants are invited to design algorithms to detect key points of apparel images. This task can help to improve the performance of applications such as alignment, recognition of the local attributes and auto-editing of the images of apparel.

#### Attributes Recognition of Apparel
Apparel attributes are the basic knowledge of fashion field, which are large and complex. We constructed a hierarchical attributes tree as a structured classification target, to describe the cognitive process of apparel. Contestants are invited to design algorithms to recognize attributes of apparel images. This task might be widely applied for apparel image searching, navigating tagging, mix-and-match recommendation, etc.

## TimeLine:
1. Application: 02.01-04.21
2. Preliminary: 03.01-04.21
